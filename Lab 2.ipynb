    "## Academic Integrity Policy\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the Academic Integrity Policy of this course, all work submitted for grading must be done individually, unless otherwise specified. While we encourage you to talk to your peers and learn from them, this interaction must be superficial with regards to all work submitted for grading. This means you cannot work in teams, you cannot work side-by-side, you cannot submit someone elseâ€™s work (partial or complete) as your own. In particular, note that you are guilty of academic dishonesty if you extend or receive any kind of unauthorized assistance. Absolutely no transfer of program code between students is permitted (paper or electronic), and you may not solicit code from family, friends, or online forums. Other examples of academic dishonesty include emailing your program to another student, copying-pasting code from the internet, working in a group on a homework assignment, and allowing a tutor, TA, or another individual to write an answer for you. \n",
    "If you have questions, please ask us on Piazza.\n",
    "You must reference (including URLs) of any resources other than those linked to in the assignment, or provided by the professor or TA.\n",
    "\n",
    "Academic dishonesty is unacceptable, and penalties range from failure to expulsion from the university; cases are handled via the official student conduct process described at https://dos.uic.edu/conductforstudents.shtml._\n",
    "\n",
    "We will run your code through MOSS software to detect copying and plagiarism.\n",
    "\n",
    "##To submit this assignment:\n",
    "1. Execute all commands and complete this notebook\t\n",
    "2. Download your Python Notebook (**.ipynb** file) and upload it to Gradescope\n",
    "under *Lab 2*. **Make sure you check that your **ipynb** file includes all parts of your solution (including the outputs).**\n",
    "2.\tExport your Notebook as a python file (**.py** file) and upload it to Gradescope under *.py file for Lab 2*. \n"

Write two functions, `extract_hour` and `extract_mins` that converts military time to hours and minutes, respectively. Hint: You may want to use modular arithmetic and integer division. Keep in mind that the data has not been cleaned and you need to check whether the extracted values are valid. Replace all the invalid values with `NaN`. The documentation for `pandas.Series.where` provided [here](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.Series.where.html) should be helpful."

    "* Cookie based user login\n",

    "* API keys\n",
    "* Custom Authentication\n",
    "\n",
    "For the NYT example below (**Q2.1**), since it is a publicly visible page we did not need to authenticate. HTTP basic authentication isn't too common for consumer sites/applications that have the concept of user accounts (like Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, etc.) but is simple to setup quickly and you often encounter it on with individual password protected pages/sites. \n",
    "\n",
    "Cookie based user login is what the majority of services use when you login with a browser (i.e. username and password). Once you sign in to a service like Facebook, the response stores a cookie in your browser to remember that you have logged in (HTTP is stateless). Each subsequent request to the same domain (i.e. any page on `facebook.com`) also sends the cookie that contains the authentication information to remind Facebook's servers that you have already logged in.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many REST APIs however use OAuth (authentication using tokens) which can be thought of a programmatic way to \"login\" _another_ user. Using tokens, a user (or application) only needs to send the login credentials once in the initial authentication and as a response from the server gets a special signed token. This signed token is then sent in future requests to the server (in place of the user credentials).\n",
    "\n",
    "A similar concept common used by many APIs is to assign API Keys to each client that needs access to server resources. The client must then pass the API Key along with _every_ request it makes to the API to authenticate. This is because the server is typically relatively stateless and does not maintain a session between subsequent calls from the same client. Most APIs (including Yelp) allow you to pass the API Key via a special HTTP Header: `Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>`. Check out the [docs](https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3/authentication) for more information."

This API, as you will see, is in version \\\\u003Ccode class=\\\\\"inline\\\\\"\\\\u003Ev0\\\\u003C\\\\u002Fcode\\\\u003E and is currently very bare-bones, meaning it doesn\\'t really provide specific endpoints to - for example - query articles, comments or users.\\\\n\\\\u003C\\\\u002Fp\\\\u003E\\\\n\\\\u003Cp\\\\u003E\\\\nBut even though it\\'s very basic it still provides all that\\'s necessary to, for example, get top stories:\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u003Cpre\\\\u003E\\\\u003Chighlight-code lang=\\\\\"python\\\\\"\\\\u003E\\\\nquery_type = \\\\\"top\\\\\"  # top\\\\u002Fbest\\\\u002Fnew, also ask\\\\u002Fshow\\\\u002Fjob\\\\nquery_url = f\\\\\"https:\\\\u002F\\\\u002Fhacker-news.firebaseio.com\\\\u002Fv0\\\\u002F{query_type}stories.json?print=pretty\\\\\"  # Top Stories\\\\nr = requests.get(query_url)\\\\nids = r.json()\\\\n\\\\ntop = ids[:10]\\\\nfor story in top:\\\\n    query_url = f\\\\\"https:\\\\u002F\\\\u002Fhacker-news.firebaseio.com\\\\u002Fv0\\\\u002Fitem\\\\u002F{story}.json?print=pretty\\\\\"\\\\n    r = requests.get(query_url)\\\\n    pprint(r.json())\\\\n\\\\u003C\\\\u002Fhighlight-code\\\\u003E\\\\u003C\\\\u002Fpre\\\\u003E\\\\n\\\\nThe snippet above is not nearly as obvious as the previous ones, so let\\'s look at it more closely. We first send request to API endpoint (\\\\u003Ccode class=\\\\\"inline\\\\\"\\\\u003Ev0\\\\u002Ftopstories\\\\u003C\\\\u002Fcode\\\\u003E), which doesn\\'t return top stories as you would expect, but really just their IDs. To get the actual stories we take these IDs (first 10 of them) and send requests to \\\\u003Ccode class=\\\\\"inline\\\\\"\\\\u003Ev0\\\\u002Fitem\\\\u002F&lt;ID&gt;\\\\u003C\\\\u002Fcode\\\\u003E endpoint which returns data for each of these individual items, which in this case happens to be a story.\\\\n\\\\u003C\\\\u002Fp\\\\u003E\\\\n\\\\u003Cp\\\\u003E\\\\nYou surely noticed that the query URL was parametrized with \\\\u003Ccode class=\\\\\"inline\\\\\"\\\\u003Equery_type\\\\u003C\\\\u002Fcode\\\\u003E.

Most large web scale companies use a combination of authentication and rate limiting to control access to their data to ensure that everyone using it abides. The first step (even before we make any request) is to setup a Yelp account if you do not have one and get API credentials.\n",

This is due to pagination and is a safeguard against returning __TOO__ much data in a single request (what would happen if there were 100,000 restaurants?) and can be used in conjuction with _rate limiting_ as well as a way to throttle and protect access to Yelp data.\n",

    "Using the provided `html_fetcher` (for a real use-case you would use `requests`), programmatically retrieve __ALL__ of the reviews for a __single__ restaurant (provided as a parameter). Just like the API was paginated, the HTML paginates its reviews (it would be a very long web page to show 300 reviews on a single page) and to get all the reviews you will need to parse and traverse the HTML. As input your function will receive a URL corresponding to a Yelp restaurant. As output return a list of dictionaries (structured the same as question 2.5) containing the relevant information from the reviews. You can use `parse_page()` here."
